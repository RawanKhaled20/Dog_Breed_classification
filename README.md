# Dog_Breed_classification
This is a project from a nanodegree course on udacity called AI Programming with Python, It marks my first project in IEEENU CIS.
The project aims to fill in the 6 functions in the check_main.py file so that we can analyze the classification ability models ("vgg", "resnet" and "alexnet") on some images of animals.
It generally tests your python knowledge in using data structures and files handling.
